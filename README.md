## 🧑‍💻 Your Task

Your bank is tired of its mainframe COBOL accounting software and they hired both of you for a greenfield project in – what a happy coincidence – your favorite programming language!

Your task is to show them that your TDD-fu and your new-age programming language can cope with good ole’ COBOL!

## 📋 Requirements

Write a class `Account` that offers the following methods:

- `void deposit(int)`
- `void withdraw(int)`
- `String printStatement()`

---

## 🧾 An example statement would be:

| Date       | Amount | Balance |
|------------|--------|---------|
| 24.12.2015 | +500   | 500     |
| 23.08.2016 | -100   | 400     |
